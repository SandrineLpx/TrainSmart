# Iteration 13 - 2026-02-16 (Documentation Sync and Audit)

## What changed
- Updated `README.md` project structure to use `docs/` (replacing stale `Documentation/`).
- Kept setup docs aligned with current repo state and clarified Windows parser helper as optional.
- Cleaned encoding artifacts in `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` (arrows/symbols/dashes).
- Added explicit historical notes to iteration logs that reference older architectures (`training_log.json`).
- Retitled `iteration_02_2026-02-10.md` as a consolidated log for Iterations 2-12 to match its actual content.

## Why
- Aligns top-level docs with current folders and data formats.
- Prevents confusion between historical and current architecture.
- Improves readability and copy/paste reliability by removing mojibake text artifacts.
