# Iteration 13 - 2026-02-16 (Documentation Sync and Audit)

## What changed
- Updated `README.md` project structure to use `docs/` (replacing stale `Documentation/`).
- Kept setup docs aligned with current repo state and clarified Windows parser helper as optional.
- Cleaned encoding artifacts in `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` (arrows/symbols/dashes).
- Added explicit historical notes to iteration logs that reference older architectures (`training_log.json`).
- Retitled `iteration_02_2026-02-10.md` as a consolidated log for Iterations 2-12 to match its actual content.

## Why
- Aligns top-level docs with current folders and data formats.
- Prevents confusion between historical and current architecture.
- Improves readability and copy/paste reliability by removing mojibake text artifacts.

## Bug fix: `/log-session` skill not registered

**Problem:** The `/log-session` skill existed at `.claude/skills/log-session/SKILL.md` but was not listed as an available skill by Claude Code. Only `checkin` and `weekly-plan` were recognized.

**Root cause:** The file had a **UTF-8 BOM** (Byte Order Mark — invisible `\xEF\xBB\xBF` bytes) at the very start. This caused the YAML frontmatter parser to fail: the `---` delimiter was no longer the first characters in the file, so the `name` and `description` fields were never parsed.

**How it was found:** Running `file` on all three SKILL.md files showed `log-session` as "UTF-8 (with BOM)" while the others were plain "UTF-8".

**Fix:** `sed -i '1s/^\xEF\xBB\xBF//' .claude/skills/log-session/SKILL.md` — stripped the BOM. Skill was immediately recognized.

**Lesson:** When creating skill files (or any file with YAML frontmatter), ensure no BOM is present. Some Windows editors (notably Notepad) add a BOM by default. Use UTF-8 without BOM.
