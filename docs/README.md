# Docs Index

Quick guide to project documentation files.

- `tutorial.md` — full assignment narrative (problem, architecture, build process, benchmark, reflection, replication).
- `handover_checklist.md` — short handoff/checklist for current system status and next steps.
- `benchmark_appendix.md` — benchmark appendix material for reporting.
- `TrainSmart_Demo.mp4` — demo video end-to-end of the current system in action.

Tip: start with `tutorial.md` for context, then use `handover_checklist.md` as an execution checklist.
