# Squat 2-Week Cycle

**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Repeat:** 2-8 times (restart after completing each cycle)
**Progression:** +2-3 kg each cycle restart
**Target RPE:** 8/10
**Days per week:** TBD
**Replaces (from base program):** Front Squat, Pause Back Squat, Goblet Squat

## Notes
- Run alongside the base WL program (Leg Drive)
- When active, drop squat exercises from the base program to avoid duplication
- Back off if leg soreness starts interfering with snatch/clean pulls
- Track which cycle you're on (e.g., "Cycle 3 of 8") when logging sessions
